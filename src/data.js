This reduced humanity’s wealth and threw back development by centuries. Ultimately, Spice emerged as the only thing that allowed higher level civilization to return in the newly poor, post computer humanity. Some humans became Mentats who, with spice, evolved into organic computing machines rather than banned computers. Similarly, Spacers were those who could pilot FTL ships due to spice, and the Bene Gesserit’s mystical powers also came from spice, allowing their influence to grow simultaneously with the new Spacer monopoly of interstellar travel."

But I think a more careful working through of the implications of spice’s value in the Universe would have made Herbert write a more plausible justification for the success of the Fremen revolt, as well as allowed him to enrich the rest of his novels in a universe that took more seriously the value of spice, and the unique position enabled to those with access to true faster than light travel. Yet, he has done so much for his readers, that I am glad for Herbert’s Dune, warts and all. The fact that it has inspired so many to devote so much attention to his universe, including the recent movie masterpiece Dune 2 from Denis Villeneuve, as well as my humble essay, is a testament to this beautiful and terrifying product of Frank Herbert’s imagination."
